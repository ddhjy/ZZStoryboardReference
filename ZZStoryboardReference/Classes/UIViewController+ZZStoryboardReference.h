/**
 In general, the storyboardName method of the view controller does't return nil, which means that the view controller can instantiate from corresponding storyboard. But when the view controller conforms to this protocol, it does't need instantiating whether its storyboardName method returns nil. This protocol is mainly supportting the unit test.
 
 @discussion Assuming that there are three view controllers: A, B and C. B and C are subclasses of A. The A does't have storyboard scene, the B and C's storyboard scenes are in the same storyboard, so we can just override A's storyboardName method. So now every thing is ok except that the A's storybaord method does't return nil but A doesn't  have corresponding storyboard. For this situation, we just make A conform to this protocol.
